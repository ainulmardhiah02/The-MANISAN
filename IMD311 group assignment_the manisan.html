    <center><h1>Our Story</h1>
    
    <p class="big" align="justify">At The Manisan, we believe in the incredible power of coffee to connect people and spark inspiration. From our humble beginnings to becoming a beloved coffee brand, our journey has been fueled by a passion for creating exceptional coffee experiences. It all started in a small corner of a busy city, where a group of friends shared a common passion for coffee. Tired of the ordinary and looking for something extraordinary, they set out on a mission to create a place where people can enjoy the best coffee and find peace amidst the chaos of everyday life. Inspired by the rich heritage of coffee and the vibrant culture it permeates, The Manisan was born. Our founder envisioned a brand synonymous with unmatched quality, genuine connection and a friendly atmosphere that transcends borders. Just like the word "manisan" means "sweet" in Indonesian, we aim to create moments that will leave lasting sweetness in our customers' lives.</p>
    
    <p class="big" align="justify">From the moment you step into Manisan cafe, you are greeted with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Our baristas, known as Coffee Craftsmen, are master craftsmen who passionately bring each cup to life, ensuring that every sip is an exceptional experience. We carefully source the best coffee beans from sustainable farms around the world, valuing the relationships we've built with farmers who share our commitment to quality and ethical practices. The heart of The Manisan beats with a sense of community. Our cafe is designed to be an inclusive space where individuals from all walks of life can gather, connect and find their own moments of respite. Whether you're looking for a quiet place to work, engage in lively conversation with friends, or simply enjoy a moment of silence with a book, The Manisan welcomes you with open arms.</p>
    
    <p class="big" align="justify">We are not only passionate about coffee; we are also dedicated to making a positive impact. Through our Coffee for a Cause program, we partner with local organizations to support initiatives that empower communities and promote sustainability. From education and healthcare to environmental conservation, we believe that by giving back, we can contribute to a brighter future. As The Manisan continues to grow, our commitment to excellence remains unwavering. We strive to surprise and delight our customers with innovative flavors, artisanal beverages, and the constant pursuit of perfection. We invite you to join us on this incredible journey and experience the magic of coffee at The Manisan.</p>
    
    <p class="big" align="justify">Together, let's enjoy every moment, celebrate the richness of coffee, and create memories as captivating as the first sip.</p>

  <center><h2>Strength and Weakness</h2>

    <p class="big" align="justify">Our strength and weakness to provide our customers the best items possible stems from the high caliber of our offerings.
    To achieve our objective of being one of the most well-known and well-liked desserts in Malaysia, there are a lot of things that we need to modernize and
    enhance. Additionally, the reliability of the data, the effectiveness of the system, and the acknowledged advantages to the individual must all play a role
    in our ability to develop a product. This is due to the fact that the weakness is mostly tied to the system's quality and little to the quality of the 
    information and support services.
    
    <p class="big" align="justify">In addition, the administrative manager, marketing manager, operations manager and financial manager are five people who are
    important to the success and efficiency of our company. The profitability and effectiveness of our business also depend on the work of five other individuals:
    the administrative manager, marketing manager, operations manager, and finance manager. We think the knowledge and abilities acquired will make it simple and
    effective to run this firm and preserve the popularity and usefulness of the product. With this, we need to broaden our corporate reach, cut operating expenses,
    boost corporate competitiveness by being able to deliver more information and services with this web mechanism efficiently and affordably, boost customer loyalty
    by removing delays, frustrations, and inefficiencies, and improve and speed up productivity.</p>

<div id="Opportunities for improvement" class="tabcontent">
  <center><h2>Opportunities for improvement</h2>
 
    <p class="big" align="justify">Product improvement is the process of making significant improvements to a product that bring in new clients or enhance the advantages being enjoyed by 
      existing clients. The two most common approaches to improve a product are to either add new features or enhance current ones. To achieve our objective of being one of Malaysia's most well-known 
      and well-liked sweets, there are many aspects we need to modernize and enhance. There are aspects that all consumers utilize and adore, and we must look for ways to improve them.
   
    
   <p class="big" align="justify">When we upgrade a product that fewer consumers purchase, the product is likely to sell quickly. Additionally, we will use this to advertise our food and 
    beverages on social media sites like Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and others. To pique consumers' interest in visiting our business, we will issue a press release on social media about the 
    new menu and other menu options. Pictures are frequently required to draw in new customers and suggest fresh uses for the product. The only enhancements that outsiders (non-customers) often learn about are new features.</p>
   
   <p class="big" align="justify">To make consumers buy more frequently or utilize the shop for more everyday activities, we also need to introduce additional merchandise or food and beverage alternatives. 
    To let clients know about the intriguing food at our store, we must post a menu on the board.</p>
